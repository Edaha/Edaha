Edaha is a modular, object oriented image BBS software written in PHP, written using the custom Kx framework and loosely based on Kusaba X. It is designed to be modular (any part of the code can be extended with modules) and easy to set up and use. 

## Developer Crap

Okay, since the code in this has historically been shitty (inconsistant line-endings and whitespace), here's what's going to happen.

### Code Formatting Rules

1. Use 2 spaces for indenting and generally stick to PSR2 formatting.
1. Use [this guide](http://help.github.com/line-endings/) to set up git for fixing line-endings.

### Getting started

1. `git clone https://github.com/Edaha/Edaha.git`
2. `docker compose up --build`

You should be good to go!
