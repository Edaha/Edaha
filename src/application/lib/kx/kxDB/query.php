/**
 * General class for an abstracted MERGE query operation.

 * MERGE INTO table_name_1 USING table_name_2 ON (condition)
 *   WHEN MATCHED THEN
 *   UPDATE SET column1 = value1 [, column2 = value2 ...]
 *   WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
 *   INSERT (column1 [, column2 ...]) VALUES (value1 [, value2 ...
 * @endcode
 *
 * Other databases (most notably MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite) will emulate
 * this statement by running a SELECT and then INSERT or UPDATE.
 *
 * By default, the two table names are identical and they are passed into the
 * the constructor. table_name_2 can be specified by the
 * MergeQuery::conditionTable() method. It can be either a string or a
 * subquery.
 *
 * The condition is built exactly like SelectQuery or UpdateQuery conditions,
 * the UPDATE query part is built similarly like an UpdateQuery and finally the
 * INSERT query part is built similarly like an InsertQuery. However, both
 * UpdateQuery and InsertQuery has a fields method so
 * MergeQuery::updateFields() and MergeQuery::insertFields() needs to be called
 * instead. MergeQuery::fields() can also be called which calls both of these
 * methods as the common case is to use the same column-value pairs for both
 * INSERT and UPDATE. However, this is not mandatory. Another convinient
 * wrapper is MergeQuery::key() which adds the same column-value pairs to the
 * condition and the INSERT query part.
 *
 * Several methods (key(), fields(), insertFields()) can be called to set a
 * key-value pair for the INSERT query part. Subsequent calls for the same
 * fields override the earlier ones. The same is true for UPDATE and key(),
 * fields() and updateFields().
